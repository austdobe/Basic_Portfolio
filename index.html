        <p>Hello, my name is Austin Dober. I have just now found my passion in programming. I am currently enrolled in the University of North Carolina Full Stack Coding bootcamp. I have found a strong love for programming and I am excited to continue my education and learn more.</p>
        <h4>Past Experience</h4>
        <p>I have spent the last 5 years in healthcare. I have enjoyed my experiences and the knowledge I have gained from this. However, I am ready to move into a new adventure. I hope to bring some healthcare expertise to programming and help create more effective methods of patient care.</p>
        <p>Prior to my healthcare time, I worked at the International Business Machine (IBM). I spent 3 years working in the computer chip fabrication factory, also called the Fab. I learned many different machines. My love for technology grew during this time. While I was working at IBM, I was continuing my education for healthcare. I spent my day in class and worked 12 hour night shifts.</p>
        <h4>Freetime activities</h4>
        <p>My freetime usually consists of spending time with my Fiancee, dog and two cats. We are fairly new to the area so we spend time enjoying what North Carolina has to offer. We have spent alot of time in Downtown Cary and Apex, as well as the many different state parks available. We also make frequent trips to the ocean and the mountains. </p>
